1) Smooth out colors in image / Apply HPF to help finding edges
    Problem: Images are noisy with greyish areas. It is difficult 
    to see the boundaries for the heart walls
2) Measure distance between edges
    Use a contour finding code?
3) Identify systole and diastole measurements
    If measurements are kept as a matrix, we 
    could go through the measurements and 
    once it peaks (either up or down) we
    know this is the systole or diastole.
